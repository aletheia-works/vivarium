  # has not yet shipped in a tagged release. Keep this attribute until the
  # provider ships ≥ v6.12.0, then migrate.

    # web_commit_signoff_required=false in the PATCH body. When the org enforces
    # signoff, this triggers a 422 "Commit signoff is enforced by the organization
    # and cannot be disabled" error, unavoidable even when the attribute is set to true.
    # This resource is kept in state purely so that other resources (labels,
    # branch_protection) can reference it; its attributes are not reconciled.
    #
    # NOTE: We tried using the nested `pages` block with a narrow
    # `ignore_changes` list in PR #29, but the provider still issues a
    # full repo PATCH whenever anything about the resource changes
    # (including a pages-only diff), so the signoff 422 still fires.
    # Pages is now managed via `pages.tf` using gh CLI instead.

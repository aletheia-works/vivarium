# Milestones — phase boundaries for the lifelong roadmap.
#
# GitHub Projects v2 has no provider resource as of
# integrations/terraform-provider-github v6.11.x (tracking issue #2916),
# so the Project board itself is click-ops. Milestones, however, are a
# stable first-class resource and belong in IaC: they are the phase
# boundaries that humans commit to, and CI / labels / ADRs reference
# them mechanically.
#
# `due_date` is deliberately omitted by default. Phase durations in the
# lifelong roadmap are directional (months → years) rather than
# commitments. Set a concrete date by adding `due_date = "YYYY-MM-DD"`
# under the relevant entry once a phase either acquires a hard target
# or has actually closed — for closed phases, `due_date` doubles as the
# closing marker, paired with `state = "closed"`.
#
# Milestone titles double as the canonical phase label surfaced on
# Issues and PRs; keep them human-readable and prefixed with the phase
# number so the GitHub UI sorts them in order.

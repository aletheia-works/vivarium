# Reproductions

Each card below is a real bug from a real upstream project, reproduced
in your browser via a WebAssembly language runtime. Click "Open" to
load the page; the verdict appears at the top once the runtime
finishes loading and the reproduction script has run.

## Vivarium contract

Every page on this gallery satisfies **`vivarium-contract: v1`**:

- `<meta name="vivarium-contract" content="v1">` declared in `<head>`.
- A DOM element with `id="verdict"` and `data-verdict="pending" |
  "pass" | "fail"`.
- Globals `__VIVARIUM_VERDICT__` (mirror) and `__VIVARIUM_RESULT__`
  (structured envelope with `bug`, `runtime`, `result`, `timing`).
- Visible verdict text starting with `reproduction succeeded` or
  `reproduction failed`.

A `pass` verdict means **the bug reproduced** — the upstream behaviour
is observable in the runtime this page just loaded. A `fail` verdict
means the runtime ships a fixed version, or the runtime errored before
producing a result. The semantics are counterintuitive in isolation
but match the project's domain noun: a *reproduction* succeeds when it
reproduces.

## Layer 1 — Pyodide (Python)

| Project | Issue | Verdict | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pandas | [#56679](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/56679) — empty `Series` / `DataFrame` dtype mismatch | `pass` (bug reproduces) | [Open ↗](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/repro/pandas-56679/) |
| numpy | [#28287](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/28287) — `timedelta64` ordering is non-transitive across generic units | `pass` (bug reproduces) | [Open ↗](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/repro/numpy-28287/) |

The Verdict column reflects what the page reports on the runtime
Vivarium currently loads (Pyodide v0.29.3 with pandas 2.3.3 and numpy
2.2.5 at the time of writing). The linked page is authoritative —
visit it to confirm the live verdict, since an upstream fix landing in
a future Pyodide release will flip the verdict to `fail`.

## Layer 1 — Ruby.wasm (Ruby)

| Project | Issue | Verdict | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ruby | [#21709](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21709) — Regexp interpolation rejects mixed encodings while String interpolation silently upgrades to UTF-8 | `pass` (bug reproduces) | [Open ↗](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/repro/ruby-21709/) |

The Verdict column reflects what the page reports on
`@ruby/3.3-wasm-wasi` (Ruby 3.3.3 over WASI) at the time of writing.
The upstream issue is currently Open with a draft patch in flight;
when a fix lands and is picked up by Ruby.wasm the verdict will flip
to `fail`.

## Adding a reproduction

A new reproduction page lives under
[`src/layer1_wasm/<project>-<issue>/`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/tree/main/src/layer1_wasm)
and ships:

- `index.html` declaring the contract version, with a `#verdict` band
  and `<script src="./repro.js">`.
- `repro.ts` that imports the runtime loader (`loadVivariumPyodide`
  for Python via Pyodide, `loadVivariumRuby` for Ruby via Ruby.wasm)
  plus `setVerdict` and `setResult` from
  [`../_shared/`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/tree/main/src/layer1_wasm/_shared)
  and publishes a `VivariumResultV1` envelope on completion.
- A short `README.md` explaining the bug and the verdict criterion.

The deploy workflow handles bundling and the `.ts` → `.js` build —
contributors only edit TypeScript sources.

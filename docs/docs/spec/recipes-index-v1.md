# Vivarium recipes index (v1)

> Machine-generated catalogue index of every reproduction this repository hosts.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | `"v1"` literal | ✅ | Format version. New optional fields ship as same-page revisions; breaking changes are v2. |
| `contract` | `"v1"` literal | ✅ | The [Contract v1](./contract-v1.md) version that recipes' pages publish. |
| `recipes` | array of [recipe entries](#recipe-entry-fields) | ✅ | Every reproduction this repository hosts, sorted by layer then by slug. |

## Recipe entry fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string (kebab-case) | ✅ | Recipe directory name under `src/layer{N}_*/`. Same convention as Manifest v1's `slug`. |
| `layer` | integer (`1` \| `2` \| `3`) | ✅ | Layer 1 = WASM in browser; Layer 2 = Docker; Layer 3 = record-replay. |
| `project` | string | ✅ | Upstream project name (e.g. `"pandas"`, `"bash"`). |
| `issue` | integer | ✅ | Upstream issue number; `0` if no upstream tracker entry. |
| `title` | string | ✅ | Human-readable title, from the recipe README's first H1. |
| `page_url` | URI | ✅ | Live reproduction page (Layer 1: WASM page; Layer 2 / 3: docker-run instructions page). |
| `verdict_url` | URI | ⏳ | Layer 2 / 3 only — deployed `verdict.json` snapshot. Layer 1 verdicts are produced live in-page and have no static snapshot. |
| `source_url` | URI | ✅ | GitHub link to the recipe directory. |

## Versioning

The version is carried as `index = "v1"` on the top-level object. Per
[ADR-0018](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/_context/decisions/0018-contract-v1-evidence-extension.md)
(private memo)'s minor-revision policy:

- **Optional additive fields** (e.g. a future `language` field once Phase 6
  stream S.1 lands frontmatter tags) ship as same-`v1` revisions; consumers
  feature-detect them.
- **Breaking changes** (renamed fields, type changes, optional → required)
  require a v2 schema sibling and a separate ADR.

There is no current v2.

## Generation

The index is built by
[`docs/scripts/generate-recipes-index.ts`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/docs/scripts/generate-recipes-index.ts),
wired into the rspress `dev` and `build` scripts in
`docs/package.json`. The script walks the recipe directories, parses each
recipe README's first H1 for the title, and derives `project` / `issue`
from the slug pattern (`<project>-<digits>` for slugs with a trailing
issue number; first dash-segment otherwise, with a small override map for
recipes whose slug shape diverges).

The output is tracked in git so PRs that add a recipe also show the index
update in the diff. Phase 6 stream S.1 will replace the slug-derived
heuristic with explicit per-recipe frontmatter, at which point the
`project` and (eventually) `language` fields become first-class
per-recipe declarations rather than slug-derived guesses.

## Conformance

A `recipes.json` document conforms to v1 when:

1. It validates against
   [`recipes.schema.json`](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/api/recipes.schema.json).
2. `index === "v1"` and `contract === "v1"`.
3. Every entry's `slug` matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
4. Every Layer 2 / 3 entry includes `verdict_url`; Layer 1 entries omit it.

Clauses 1–3 are mechanically enforceable via schema validation. Clause 4
is a derivation-rule constraint not encoded in the schema's `oneOf` (kept
deliberately permissive: the MCP server treats a missing `verdict_url` on
a Layer 2 / 3 entry the same as `verdict_url` pointing at a 404 — both
are surfaced to the consumer as "no snapshot available").

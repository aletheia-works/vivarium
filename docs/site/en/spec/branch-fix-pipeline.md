# Branch-fix verdict pipeline

> A `workflow_dispatch` GitHub Actions workflow that captures a
> [Contract v1](./contract-v1.md) verdict for a contributor-supplied
> branch-fix Docker image, alongside the deployed original verdict,
> for side-by-side comparison.

The workflow lives at
[`.github/workflows/branch-fix-verdict.yml`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/.github/workflows/branch-fix-verdict.yml).

## Five-line invocation

```bash
gh workflow run branch-fix-verdict.yml \
  --repo aletheia-works/vivarium \
  -f slug=bash-local-shadows-exit \
  -f branch_image=ghcr.io/contributor/bash-fix:branch-x \
  -f expected_verdict=unreproduced
```

The run page renders a Markdown comparison summary, and the captured
verdicts are uploaded as a workflow artefact named
`branch-fix-verdict-<slug>-<run_id>` for download or programmatic
fetch.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string | ✅ | — | Recipe slug under [`src/layer2_docker/`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/tree/main/src/layer2_docker), e.g. `bash-local-shadows-exit`. The slug must exist in tree on the workflow's checkout; the workflow fails fast on a typo. |
| `branch_image` | string | ✅ | — | Docker image ref to verify (e.g. `ghcr.io/contributor/foo-fix:branch-x`). Must be pullable by the runner without authentication. Private-registry support is a follow-up. |
| `expected_verdict` | choice (`reproduced`\|`unreproduced`) | — | `unreproduced` | Verdict the contributor expects on the branch-fix image. `unreproduced` (bug does NOT reproduce) is the typical "fix works" answer. The workflow's final step asserts the captured verdict matches this and exits non-zero on divergence. |
| `original_image` | string | — | (empty) | Optional override. By default the workflow fetches the deployed original verdict from GitHub Pages — cheaper than re-running an image and identical to what the gallery serves. Supplying an `original_image` re-captures from that image instead, useful for anchoring the comparison at a specific tag or testing a private fork. |

## Verdict semantics (reminder)

`reproduced` means **the upstream bug reproduces** in this run.
`unreproduced` means it **does not**. See
[Contract v1: Verdict semantics](./contract-v1.md#verdict-semantics)
for the full reasoning.

For a recipe whose original verdict is `reproduced`, a successful
branch-fix is therefore expected to flip the verdict to
`unreproduced`. For a recipe whose original verdict is already
`unreproduced` (a sentinel page tracking an upstream-fix-detected
event), a contributor is unlikely to need this workflow at all.

## Artefact

The workflow uploads a directory artefact named
`branch-fix-verdict-<slug>-<run_id>` with 30-day retention. The
bundle contains:

| File | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `branch-fix-verdict.json` | Captured live from `branch_image`. | Always present. Conforms to [Contract v1](./contract-v1.md) and validates against [`verdict.schema.json`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/docs/site/public/spec/verdict.schema.json). |
| `original-verdict.json` | Default: fetched from `https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/repro/<project>/<issue_path>/verdict.json` (the `page_url` value from the recipe's entry in `recipes.json`, with `verdict.json` appended). With `original_image`: captured from that image. | Omitted when the deployed Pages snapshot returns 404 (e.g. brand-new recipe not yet on the live site). |

The R.3 comparison-page UI consumes this exact bundle structure;
naming the files this way commits R.2 to a wire format R.3 can
program against without further coordination.

## Comparison summary

The workflow writes a Markdown table to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`,
visible on the run page:

| | original | branch-fix |
|---|---|---|
| verdict | (e.g.) `reproduced` | (e.g.) `unreproduced` |
| exit code | (e.g.) 0 | (e.g.) 1 |

…followed by a one-line "matches expected" / "does NOT match
expected" line for the `expected_verdict` assertion. The Markdown
summary is the at-a-glance view in the workflow run page; for the
side-by-side comparison surface, drop the workflow artefact zip on
the [comparison page](../repro/compare.mdx) (file-drop or paste). The
artefact is the source of truth either way.

## What this pipeline does **not** do

- **Build the branch-fix image.** The contributor is expected to
  build and publish to a registry the runner can pull from. The image
  is the input boundary of this pipeline.
- **Verify Layer 1 (WASM) reproductions.** Layer 1 verdicts are
  produced live in-page by a browser; there is no Docker image to
  swap.
- **Authenticate to private registries.** v1 assumes the supplied
  image ref is anonymously pullable.

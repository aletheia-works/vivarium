## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | `"v1"` literal | ✅ | Format version. New optional fields ship as same-page revisions; breaking changes are v2. |
| `contract` | `"v1"` literal | ✅ | The [Contract v1](./contract-v1.md) version that recipes' pages publish. |
| `recipes` | array of [recipe entries](#recipe-entry-fields) | ✅ | Every reproduction this repository hosts, sorted by layer then by slug. |

## Recipe entry fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string (kebab-case) | ✅ | Recipe directory name under `src/layer{N}_*/`. Same convention as Manifest v1's `slug`. |
| `layer` | integer (`1` \| `2` \| `3`) | ✅ | Layer 1 = WASM in browser; Layer 2 = Docker; Layer 3 = record-replay. |
| `project` | string | ✅ | Upstream project name (e.g. `"pandas"`, `"bash"`). |
| `issue` | integer | ✅ | Upstream issue number; `0` if no upstream tracker entry. |
| `title` | string | ✅ | Human-readable title, from the recipe README's first H1. |
| `page_url` | URI | ✅ | Live reproduction page (Layer 1: WASM page; Layer 2 / 3: docker-run instructions page). |
| `verdict_url` | URI | ⏳ | Layer 2 / 3 only — deployed `verdict.json` snapshot. Layer 1 verdicts are produced live in-page and have no static snapshot. |
| `source_url` | URI | ✅ | GitHub link to the recipe directory. |
| `language` | string | ⏳ | Optional. Primary implementation language, lowercase (e.g. `"python"`, `"rust"`, `"shell"`). Sourced from the per-recipe [`recipe.json`](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/spec/recipe.schema.json) under `src/layer*_*/<slug>/`. Added in the 2026-05-03 revision; the 2026-05-18 revision moved the source from the retired `docs/site/_data/recipe-facets.json` overlay to the per-recipe file. |
| `symptom` | string (kebab-case) | ⏳ | Optional. Short symptom slug used by the error → recipe matcher (e.g. `"dtype-mismatch"`, `"ordering-non-transitive"`). Sourced from `recipe.json`. Added 2026-05-03. |
| `severity` | string | ⏳ | Optional. Free-form severity bucket (e.g. `"bug"`, `"regression"`, `"spec-violation"`, `"footgun"`). Sourced from `recipe.json`. Added 2026-05-03. |
| `tags` | array of strings | ⏳ | Optional. Free-form tag list scored by the matcher (e.g. `["sqlite3", "pragma", "foreign-keys"]`). Sourced from `recipe.json`. Added 2026-05-03. |
| `expected_verdict` | string (enum) | ⏳ | Optional. Verdict the regression suite expects the recipe page to produce — `"reproduced"` or `"unreproduced"`. Sourced from `recipe.json`. Added in the 2026-05-18 revision. |
| `expected_runtime` | string | ⏳ | Optional. Runtime identifier the recipe's verdict envelope reports in `__VIVARIUM_RESULT__.runtime.name` (e.g. `"pyodide"`, `"docker-snapshot"`, `"rr-replay"`). Sourced from `recipe.json`. Added 2026-05-18. |

## Versioning

The version is carried as `index = "v1"` on the top-level object.

- **Optional additive fields** ship as same-`v1` revisions; consumers
  feature-detect them.
- **Breaking changes** (renamed fields, type changes, optional → required)
  require a v2 schema sibling.

There is no current v2.

## Revision history

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-03 | Added optional `language`, `symptom`, `severity`, `tags` fields to recipe entries. Sourced from a centralised facet overlay (`docs/site/_data/recipe-facets.json`), not per-recipe frontmatter. Backwards-compatible — v1 consumers ignore. |
| 2026-05-18 | Added optional `expected_verdict` / `expected_runtime` fields, and moved the source of the existing `language` / `symptom` / `severity` / `tags` fields from the retired `docs/site/_data/recipe-facets.json` overlay to per-recipe `src/layer*_*/<slug>/recipe.json` files (schema: [`recipe.schema.json`](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/spec/recipe.schema.json)). Backwards-compatible — v1 consumers ignore the new fields and read the existing ones unchanged. |

## Generation

The index is built by
[`docs/scripts/generate-recipes-index.ts`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/docs/scripts/generate-recipes-index.ts),
wired into the rspress `dev` and `build` scripts in
`docs/package.json`. The script walks the recipe directories, parses each
recipe README's first H1 for the title, and derives `project` / `issue`
from the slug pattern (`<project>-<digits>` for slugs with a trailing
issue number; first dash-segment otherwise, with a small override map for
recipes whose slug shape diverges).

The output is tracked in git so PRs that add a recipe also show the index
update in the diff. The optional facet fields (`language`, `symptom`,
`severity`, `tags`, `expected_verdict`, `expected_runtime`) are read
from the per-recipe `src/layer*_*/<slug>/recipe.json` file (schema:
[`recipe.schema.json`](https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/spec/recipe.schema.json));
the recipe ships its own metadata, so adding a recipe is a one-directory
change. The `project` field stays slug-derived in v1.

## Conformance

A `recipes.json` document conforms to v1 when:

1. It validates against
   [`recipes.schema.json`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/docs/site/public/api/recipes.schema.json).
2. `index === "v1"` and `contract === "v1"`.
3. Every entry's `slug` matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
4. Every Layer 2 / 3 entry includes `verdict_url`; Layer 1 entries omit it.

Clauses 1–3 are mechanically enforceable via schema validation. Clause 4
is a derivation-rule constraint not encoded in the schema's `oneOf` (kept
deliberately permissive: the MCP server treats a missing `verdict_url` on
a Layer 2 / 3 entry the same as `verdict_url` pointing at a 404 — both
are surfaced to the consumer as "no snapshot available").

## See also

- [Contract v1](./contract-v1.md) — the runtime verdict surface each
  recipe page publishes.
- [Manifest v1](./manifest-v1.md) — the upstream-side manifest format an
  external repo ships at `.vivarium/manifest.toml`. Recipe entries in
  this index correspond to internal recipes; external repos publish their
  own per-repo manifest instead of being listed here.

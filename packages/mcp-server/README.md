# `@aletheia-works/vivarium-mcp`

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that
exposes the [Vivarium](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium)
reproduction catalogue to AI agent clients (Claude Code, Cline, Cursor,
Continue, etc.).

Vivarium is the universal bug-reproduction platform of the
[`aletheia-works`](https://github.com/aletheia-works) organisation —
"reproduce any bug, in any language, any environment, at any scale."
This package is the agent-callable surface that lets AI tools
*discover* what reproductions exist, look up their metadata, and read
deployed verdict snapshots, without scraping the docs site.

## Tools

| Tool | Returns | Layer coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `list_recipes(layer?, project?, q?)` | Filtered list of catalogue entries. | All layers (1, 2, 3). |
| `get_recipe(slug)` | Full metadata for one recipe (title, project, issue, page URL, verdict snapshot URL, GitHub source URL). | All layers. |
| `lookup_verdict(slug)` | Layer 1 → `kind: "live"` + page URL (verdicts run in the browser). Layer 2/3 → `kind: "snapshot"` with the deployed `verdict.json` contents (verdict, exit code, image digest, stdout, stderr tail). | All layers (Layer 1 returns a stub). |
| `match_error(text, limit?)` | Mechanical token-overlap ranking of recipes against a pasted error message or stack trace. Synonym table + bounded fuzzy match + multi-language stopwords (Phase 7 A5). | All layers. |
| `verify_branch_fix(slug, fix_url? \| fix_source?)` | Scaffolding helper for the AI-slop verification loop. Layer 1 → Path A: a recipe-page `compare_url` with the fix pre-loaded. Layer 2/3 → Path B: a `/repro/compare` deep-link plus the `gh workflow run branch-fix-verdict.yml` command. NOT an execution engine — actual reproduction runs in the visitor's browser (Path A) or in GitHub Actions (Path B). | All layers. |
| `prepare_new_recipe(project, issue, title, base_image?, repo_owner?, layer?)` | Scaffolding helper that bundles every artefact an agent needs to author a new recipe: validated slug, the exact `mise run recipes:new` and `mise run recipes:verify` commands, placeholder rows for `docs/data/recipe-facets.json` and (if the project is new) `docs/data/projects.json`, a commit-subject template, and a sequenced next-steps checklist. Validates the slug against the `docs/scripts/generate-recipes-index.ts` parser regex at call time. NOT an execution engine — the agent's shell tool runs the returned commands. | Layer 2 has the canonical scaffolder; Layer 1/3 fall back to copying from an existing recipe. |

## Install

> **Status (2026-05-06)**: not yet published to a registry. The
> `mcp-server-v0.1.0` tag has not been pushed, so the `npx` and
> `bunx jsr:` snippets below would 404 today. Until the first publish,
> use the local-clone path. The
> [`publish-mcp.yml`](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml)
> workflow handles dual JSR + npm release on tag push; the snippets
> in the next two subsections will work once that runs for the first
> time.

### Local clone (works today)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium.git
cd vivarium/packages/mcp-server
bun install
bun run build
```

Then point your MCP client at the built entry point:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vivarium": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vivarium/packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### npm (post-publish; default for `npx`-based MCP launchers)

Once the server has been published, the configuration becomes a
single-line `npx` invocation. The exact MCP-config file location
varies by client (Claude Code: `~/.claude/mcp.json`; Cline: its VS
Code settings; Cursor: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`). Snippet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vivarium": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aletheia-works/vivarium-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### JSR (post-publish; Deno / Bun-native install)

For clients with native JSR support (Bun ≥ 1.1, Deno):

```bash
bunx jsr:@aletheia-works/vivarium-mcp
# or
deno run --allow-net --allow-read jsr:@aletheia-works/vivarium-mcp
```

## Why dual-channel distribution

Per [ADR-0019](https://github.com/aletheia-works/vivarium) (private
memo), this package publishes to both registries with **JSR canonical
and npm fallback**. JSR contributes structural supply-chain defences
(no postinstall scripts, OIDC-only publish via Sigstore provenance,
GitHub-org-bound scope ownership, source-only publish); npm carries
the `npx` ergonomics most MCP launchers expect today. Both registries
ship with build provenance — verifiable via the public Sigstore Rekor
transparency log.

## Configuration

The server reads no environment variables and accepts no command-line
flags in v1. It fetches the catalogue index from
<https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/api/recipes.json> with a
5-minute in-process TTL, falling back to a build-time bundled snapshot
when the network is unavailable.

## Versioning

The MCP server's surface (the three tools above and their input
schemas) is locked at v1 by ADR-0019. Optional additive changes ship
as minor revisions; breaking changes require a v2 design ADR.

The recipes index format consumed by this server is locked separately
at `index = "v1"` — see
<https://aletheia-works.github.io/vivarium/spec/recipes-index-v1>.

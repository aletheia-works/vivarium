/* Vivarium Layer 3 reproduction — canonical pthread lost-update race.
 *
 * Two threads each increment a shared counter `ITERATIONS` times with
 * no synchronisation. After both threads join, the counter should
 * equal 2*ITERATIONS, but on x86 with -O2 some increments are lost
 * to interleaving. The resulting unsynchronised read-modify-write is
 * the canonical "lost update" data race used in nearly every
 * concurrency textbook.
 *
 * Designed to be the smallest possible Layer 3 reproduction:
 *
 *   exit 0  →  pass (counter == 2*ITERATIONS — race did NOT fire)
 *   exit 1  →  fail (counter <  2*ITERATIONS — race fired, bug
 *                    reproduces)
 *
 * Layer 1 / Layer 2 verdict semantics are flipped for catalogue
 * purposes (`pass` means "the bug reproduces"). Layer 3 follows the
 * same convention via `replay.sh`, which inspects the recorded
 * stderr to detect the race rather than relying on this binary's
 * exit code alone — `rr replay --autopilot` does not propagate the
 * recorded program's exit status to its caller.

 * small (~1 MB) while leaving plenty of interleavings for chaos

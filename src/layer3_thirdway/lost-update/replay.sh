# Vivarium Layer 3 reproduction — canonical pthread lost-update race.
#
# Visitor-facing replay invocation. Runs `rr replay --autopilot`
# against the trace baked into the image at /trace and emits the
# gallery verdict by parsing the recorded program's stderr.
#
# Verdict semantics (match Layer 1 / Layer 2):
#
#   exit 0 → `pass` — bug reproduces; the recorded race re-fires
#                     deterministically on replay.
#   exit 1 → `fail` — bug did not reproduce; either the trace
#                     replayed clean (no lost increments — should
#                     be impossible for this trace, captured here
#                     defensively) or `rr replay` itself errored.
#
# Why we parse stderr instead of the replay exit code:
# `rr replay --autopilot` exit code reports whether the replay run
# completed successfully (no rr-internal divergence), NOT the
# recorded program's exit code. Verified against `rr` 5.7:
# `rr record /bin/false` (exits 1) → `rr replay --autopilot` exits
# 0. So we look at the recorded stderr — `repro.c` prints
# `counter = N, expected = M, lost = K` on every run, and `K` is
# non-zero exactly when the race fired during recording (which is
# what we recorded with `rr record --chaos` on purpose).

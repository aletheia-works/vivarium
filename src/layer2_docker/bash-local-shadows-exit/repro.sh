#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Vivarium Layer 2 reproduction — bash `local` shadows the exit
# code of command substitution, defeating `set -e`.
#
# Documented behaviour, not a code defect: `local` is a builtin
# whose own exit code (0 on successful local-variable creation)
# overrides the exit code of the right-hand-side command
# substitution. `set -e` only sees `local`'s 0, so a failing
# command on the RHS goes silent.
#
# Verdict semantics (catalogue model from ADR-0010):
#   exit 0 -> pass — the surprise reproduces (set -e bypassed when
#                    using `local`)
#   exit 1 -> fail — bash now propagates the RHS exit code through
#                    `local`, or runtime errored
#
# Two parallel demos are run inside subshells so a non-zero exit
# from the demo doesn't kill our wrapper before we can compare.
